I’m passionate about full-stack web development and game development, and I also enjoy challenging myself with low-level programming, OS development, and server management.
<br><br> Over the years, I’ve played a key role in developing, managing, and maintaining various e-commerce platforms, handling everything from frontend to backend and building integrations with systems like management software, payment solutions (ApplePay, GooglePay, PayPal), and Java applications.
<br><br> Right now, I’m also part of a small team of Unity developers working on a self-funded mobile game. Previously, I contributed to eestec.net, a nonprofit project, where I helped with coordination, development, and DevOps in a Laravel + React environment.
<br><br> Overall, I’d say I’m a versatile and resourceful developer who’s focused on creating efficient, reliable solutions across the tech stack.',
